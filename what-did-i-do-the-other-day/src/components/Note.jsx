/*TODO: 
*Read about how to create a controlled component
*Create a counter, EX: once you click a button five times have it show a message on the screen. Showing how to manipulate state
*Add a button
*add an X button to reset the game
*2 states: (Int)Count, (Bool)whether or not to show the message
*Figure out how to take in text, within an textarea input (HTML)
* - Get it set up so you can have a user input text
* - Button that takes the text in the input and put it into an HTML tag as a DIV OR A P
* - Hint: Your  input is a conduit for the user to write something into the state
* - The button that you hit, needs to clear out the input & remove the text
